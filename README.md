# Narrating Time: A TimelineJS Workshop

This Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities workshop was held virtually on February 10, 2021. I led the workshop, which invited participants to create their own timeline using TimelineJS, a tool by Northwestern's Knight Lab, as well as reflect on the affordances and limitations of TimelineJS as a digital humanities tool.
